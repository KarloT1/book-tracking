## Book Tracking App

This project was made as a part of final assignment for my university bachelor's degree.  
This is a book tracking app in which user has  
the ability to add his books to favorites,  
as well as create new books using custom data  
or an ISBN-10/ISBN-13 code.

### Guide to start the project

In order for this project to work, first run:

#### `json-server --watch db.json --port 8080`

in order for the "database" to work.  
Then to start the application run:

#### `npm start`

This runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
